## 🚀 What is MalgoCAT?

**MalgoCAT** is an AI-powered assistant that analyzes your dataset and problem context to **recommend the most suitable machine learning algorithms** — with reasoning, trade-offs, and competition-ready strategies.

Think of it as:
- 🧠 *ML intuition in software form*
- ⚔️ *A silent Kaggle teammate*
- 🧭 *A guide from confusion → clarity*

You upload a dataset.  
You define your goal.  
**MalgoCAT tells you what model actually makes sense — and why.**

---

## ✨ Why MalgoCAT exists

Most beginners ask:
> “Which algorithm should I use?”

Most AutoML tools answer:
> “Here’s the best score.”

**MalgoCAT answers something better:**
> “This algorithm fits your data *because* of these properties — and here’s what to try next.”

This project is built to **teach intuition**, not just output numbers.

## 🧬 Core Capabilities

### 📊 Dataset Fingerprinting
MalgoCAT automatically inspects your dataset for:
- Class imbalance ⚖️
- Missing value patterns 🧩
- Feature types (numerical / categorical / sparse)
- Correlation strength 🔗
- Dataset size & dimensionality
- Noise & skewness

---

### 🧠 Algorithm Recommendation Engine
Based on the fingerprint + problem goal, MalgoCAT:
- Ranks ML algorithms by suitability
- Assigns confidence scores
- Explains strengths & failure cases
- Suggests alternatives

**Supported families:**
- Linear Models
- Tree-based Models 🌲
- Ensemble Methods
- Gradient Boosting (XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost)
- SVM / kNN / Naive Bayes
- Neural Networks 🧠

---

### ⚔️ Competition Mode
Designed for hackathons & Kaggle-style contests:
- Time-budget based recommendations ⏱️
- Metric-aware strategy (F1, AUC, RMSE, etc.)
- Fast baseline vs strong leaderboard model
- Feature engineering hints
- Hyperparameter guidance

This is not theory — it’s **playbook-style advice**.

---

### 📘 Learning Mode
MalgoCAT doesn’t hide complexity — it explains it:
- Why certain models work on tabular data
- When simple models beat deep learning
- Visual comparisons between algorithms
- Code snippets you can actually run
